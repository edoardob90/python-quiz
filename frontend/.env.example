# Backend API Configuration
# For local development:
PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:8000
PUBLIC_BACKEND_WS=ws://localhost:8000

# For Railway/production, use your deployed backend URLs:
# PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=https://your-backend.up.railway.app
# PUBLIC_BACKEND_WS=wss://your-backend.up.railway.app

# Note: Railway automatically provides HTTPS, so use wss:// (not ws://) for WebSocket in production
